# Twittler
![Twittler!](http://i.imgur.com/Asq9E9h.jpg)
A mini-project created as part of the Hack Reactor pre-course curriculum to learn and get exposure to jQuery and the DOM.

It also served as a good exercise to get some hands-on work with HTML and CSS.

Tweets are randomly generated every 20-40 seconds (or when the user composes one).

## Demo
